# Pending Technical Tasks: AI Agents Development Suite

Based on the project brief and the current progress, the following technical tasks are pending to achieve the project's objective of developing a complete suite of productive AI Agents to generate $10K+ MRR in 90 days.

**Phase 1: MVP Deployment and Testing**
*   [ ] Configure environment variables for Docker deployment.
*   [ ] Run the Docker container locally.
*   [ ] Verify the FastAPI API is accessible within the container.
*   [ ] Trigger the basic Lead Qualification workflow via the API.
*   [ ] Monitor container logs for errors and successful execution.
*   [ ] Confirm data is being stored correctly in Supabase.
*   [ ] Conduct basic end-to-end testing of the Lead Qualification workflow.
*   [ ] Document any issues encountered during deployment and testing.

**Phase 2: Core Agent Implementation (Following Specification)**
*   [ ] Implement the Content Generation Agent based on the technical specification.
*   [ ] Implement the Outreach Automation Agent based on the technical specification.
*   [ ] Implement the Analytics Agent based on the technical specification.
*   [ ] Develop necessary tools for each new agent (e.g., content generation tools, email/messaging tools, analytics reporting tools).
*   [ ] Integrate new agents with the `MultiProvider` and `SupabaseClient`.
*   [ ] Write unit tests for each new agent and their tools.

**Phase 3: Swarms Workflow Development**
*   [ ] Design and implement complex Swarms workflows (e.g., Lead to Conversion workflow) using `SequentialWorkflow`, `AgentRearrange`, and `MixtureOfAgents`.
*   [ ] Define the interaction logic and data flow between different agents within workflows.
*   [ ] Test workflows thoroughly to ensure correct execution and agent collaboration.

**Phase 4: API Development and Integration**
*   [ ] Develop FastAPI endpoints for triggering all agents and workflows.
*   [ ] Implement request validation and response formatting.
*   [ ] Integrate API with authentication and authorization mechanisms (if required by spec).
*   [ ] Add API documentation (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger).

**Phase 5: Monitoring, Alerting, and Cost Management**
*   [ ] Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection from agents, workflows, and API.
*   [ ] Configure Sentry for error reporting.
*   [ ] Utilize LangSmith for tracing and debugging agent/workflow execution.
*   [ ] Implement alerting based on key metrics and errors.
*   [ ] Enhance cost tracking and reporting mechanisms.

**Phase 6: Containerization and Orchestration**
*   [ ] Update Dockerfile to include all necessary dependencies and application code.
*   [ ] Create/Update Kubernetes manifests (`k8s/deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.) for deployment.
*   [ ] Configure Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive environment variables.
*   [ ] Implement health and readiness checks for Kubernetes.

**Phase 7: CI/CD Pipeline**
*   [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) for automated testing and deployment.
*   [ ] Configure automated builds, tests, and deployments to staging/production environments.

**Phase 8: Production Deployment and Optimization**
*   [ ] Deploy the application to a production Kubernetes cluster.
*   [ ] Configure scaling policies based on load.
*   [ ] Monitor production performance and costs.
*   [ ] Implement optimizations based on monitoring data.

**Phase 9: Testing (Comprehensive)**
*   [ ] Develop comprehensive integration tests covering agent interactions and workflows.
*   [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
*   [ ] Set up performance testing.

**Phase 10: Frontend Development (Future)**
*   [ ] (As outlined in the project brief, frontend is a future phase and will be scoped later).
